# ShopifyDSChallenge2022 ðŸ¥‡

### In order to make this repo as simple as possible to navigate. Here is the breakdown of what I uploaded:
1) The challenge2022_Q1 [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/akhalifaa/ShopifyDSChallenge2022/blob/main/Challenge2022_Q1.ipynb) contains all my thought process, code executions and relevant charts. Navigate the notebook from top to bottom to see how I came up with my final solutions.
2) The challenge2022_Q2 [SQL file](https://github.com/akhalifaa/ShopifyDSChallenge2022/blob/main/Challenge2022_Q2.sql) contains all my code executions for the three questions along with the final answers commented out.
3) Additionally, I have a [FinalAnswers](https://github.com/akhalifaa/ShopifyDSChallenge2022/blob/main/FinalAnswers.md) markdown file that showcases my concise final answers for both Q1 and Q2.
